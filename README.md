# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection Using Deep Learning Methods

### NEUROMATCH 2024 - NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
#### A Novel Approach for Detecting Fake News using Deep Learning Methods

---

## Project Overview

In this notebook, we propose several embedding and model pairs to classify news articles as either real or fake. The following approaches were explored:

1. **GloVe Embeddings + LSTM (both uni/bidirectional models)**
2. **TFIDF + Logistic Regression**
3. **CountVectorizer + Logistic Regression**
4. **Pretrained Tokenizer + Transformer Model from BERT**

## Installation and Setup

To run this project, you'll need to install the required libraries. Use the following commands to set up your environment:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn torch torchtext scikit-learn tqdm
```
## Usage

Using [preprocessing notebook](/fake_news_detection_preprocessing.ipynb), you can download the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets' >original dataset <a/> and apply whichever preprocessing steps you'd like.



###  Import the Dataset

You can either import the preprocessed data (`news_df_processed.csv`) or the raw dataframe that is of the form `{'label': (0 or 1), 'content': (article string)}`.

```python
news_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/news_df_processed.csv')
```
### GPU Limitations
If you are going to run the notebook on base version GPU's, we highly recommend keeping `embedding_dimensions` under 250. Otherwise your session might crash and you'd lose all your progress. 

### Training BERT Model

Beware of the fact that each training epoch takes **10 mins** on 15.84 GB Tesla T4 GPU.

```python
history = model.fit(x = {'input_ids':X_train_token['input_ids'],'input_mask':X_train_token['attention_mask']}, y = Y_train, epochs=2, validation_split = 0.2, batch_size = 30, callbacks=[callback])
```
